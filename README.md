To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

 
### Installation


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up the app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OneEyeX/Currency-Converter.git
   ```
2. Development server

Run  
  ```sh
  ng serve 
  ```

for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

3. Code scaffolding

Run 
  ```sh
  ng generate component component-name
  ```
 to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

4. Build

Run 
  ```sh
  ng build
  ``` 
 to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

5. Running unit tests

Run 
```sh
ng test
``` 
to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

6. Running end-to-end tests

Run 
```sh
ng e2e
```
 to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
